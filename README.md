# Dataquest Projects
This repository contains guided projects I complete while undertaking the Data Science in Python track at [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). Each one therefore represents a snapshot of my learning journey as my skills develop. I am uploading these into this repository after having worked through a number of them; some of the earlier ones will have some personal notes added after reading through them again, as I reflect on what I have learned since doing the main work for the projects while tidying them up at the same time for public consumption. I am also treating this repository as a sandpit to become familiar with using GitHub and Git workflows.  
  
The primary purpose is to collate my Dataquest guided projects in one place as a log of my learning journey. Perhaps this will even be useful for someone considering picking up Python as a new skill and is curious about an example learning process.  
  
I expect that there will eventually be at least 1 or 2 projects in here that I will want to display more proudly for potential employers to look through; rather than just point these out I will make clones of them in separate repositories for ease of access and consumption.
