# Dataquest Projects
This repository contains guided projects I have completed while undertaking the Data Science in Python track at [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). Publically available projects are an excellent way to demonstrate skills, and I hope this repository shows how my Data Science skills have developed through my training at Dataquest.
