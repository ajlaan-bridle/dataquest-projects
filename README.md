# Dataquest Projects
This repository contains guided projects I complete while undertaking the Data Science in Python track at [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/). I am putting these on here as a keepsake and something of a timeline of how my Python skills develop as I work through the online training. I am also treating this as a sandpit to become familiar with using GitHub. Perhaps this will be useful for someone considering picking up Python as a new skill and is curious about an example learning process.  
  
I hope that there will be at least 1 or 2 projects in here that I will want to display more proudly for potential employers to look through; rather than point these out I will just clone these in separate repositories.
