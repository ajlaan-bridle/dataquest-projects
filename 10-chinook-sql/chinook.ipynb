    "\n",
    "Chinook's customer purchasing system either allows an album to be purchased in a single order, or a selection of tracks to be selected for an order, but does not allow an entire album to be selected followed by individually selected tracks in an order (unless all individual tracks in an album are selected).\n",

    "1. Temporary view `album_lookup`, which joins `invoice_line` and `track` on 'track_id', grouping by 'invoice_id'. This selects an album ID for each invoice; there is no need to be selective on which album ID within a given invoice.\n",
    "2. Temporary view `album_tracks`, which joins `album_lookup` and `track` on `album_id`, generating a set of album tracks for each invoice ID. This is to later provide a comparison to see if a given invoice was to purchase a whole album or a set of individual tracks.\n",
    "3. Temporary view `invoice_tracks`, which joins `invoice_line` and `track` on 'track_id' without any grouping. This provides the list of tracks for each invoice.\n",
    "4. Temporary view `classification`, which compares (2) and (3) using an EXCEPT clause, to classify each invoice as 'album' or 'tracks'\n",
    "5. Main query pulls from (4) the purchase type (album or tracks), and calculates for each type: the number of invoices, the percentage of invoices, and the total associated revenue."

    "Just over 20% of orders (invoices) are for albums, but these account for around a third of store revenue. One crucial dimension that has not been assessed (because the data is not in the database) is the cost to Chinook for purchasing tracks/albums from labels for onward retail. If the store decides to only purchase a couple of popular tracks from albums instead of the full albums, then the cost of buying from labels reduces. However, the potential revenue from full album sales also reduces, because the margins from the less popular tracks are no longer available (assuming all tracks have a positive margin associated with them). Without assessing how this could balance out, it is difficult to make a recommendation. There is also a risk that some 'album' sales may not convert to 'tracks' sales for customers who prefer to purchase full albums; without stocking full albums these customers may be lost as a result of the proposed purchasing strategy."
